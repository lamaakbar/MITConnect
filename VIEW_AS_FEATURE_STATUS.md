# View As Feature - Current Status

## âœ… What's Working

### 1. Core State Management
- âœ… `viewAs` state in `UserContext.tsx` 
- âœ… `effectiveRole` derived state (viewAs || userRole)
- âœ… `setViewAs` function with logging
- âœ… State persistence across navigation

### 2. Admin Home Screen
- âœ… "View As" buttons (Admin, Employee, Trainee)
- âœ… Debug info display showing current state
- âœ… "Reset to Admin View" button
- âœ… Preview mode banner at top
- âœ… Navigation to employee-home and trainee-home

### 3. Employee Home Screen
- âœ… Preview mode indicator in header
- âœ… Preview mode banner with "Exit Preview" button
- âœ… Debug logging for viewAs state

### 4. Trainee Home Screen
- âœ… Preview mode indicator in header
- âœ… Preview mode banner with "Exit Preview" button
- âœ… Debug logging for viewAs state

### 5. Event Registration Prevention
- âœ… `event-details.tsx`: Registration blocked in preview mode
- âœ… `EventCard.tsx`: Registration blocked in preview mode
- âœ… Alert messages explaining preview mode

### 6. Return to Admin Functionality
- âœ… Multiple "Return to Admin View" buttons
- âœ… Banner buttons on all screens
- âœ… Reset button in admin home
- âœ… Proper navigation back to admin-home

## ðŸ”§ Debug Features Added

### Console Logging
- âœ… UserContext: setViewAs calls logged
- âœ… Admin Home: handleViewAs calls logged
- âœ… Event Details: viewAs state logged
- âœ… Events: viewAs state logged
- âœ… EventCard: viewAs state logged
- âœ… Employee Home: viewAs state logged
- âœ… Trainee Home: viewAs state logged

### Visual Debug Info
- âœ… Debug panel in admin home showing current state
- âœ… Preview mode indicators in headers
- âœ… Preview mode banners on all screens

## ðŸŽ¯ User Requirements Status

### âœ… "Can't return to admin page"
- **FIXED**: Multiple return buttons implemented
- **FIXED**: Banner buttons on all screens
- **FIXED**: Reset button in admin home

### âœ… "Can still register for events in preview mode"
- **FIXED**: Registration blocked in event-details.tsx
- **FIXED**: Registration blocked in EventCard.tsx
- **FIXED**: Alert messages shown

### âœ… "Need a way to return as admin"
- **FIXED**: Multiple return mechanisms implemented
- **FIXED**: Clear visual indicators
- **FIXED**: Easy-to-find buttons

## ðŸš¨ Potential Issues

### 1. State Persistence
- The `viewAs` state is not persisted to AsyncStorage
- State resets on app restart
- **Impact**: Low - this is expected behavior for preview mode

### 2. Navigation Stack
- Using `router.replace()` instead of `router.push()`
- **Impact**: Low - this prevents back button issues

### 3. RoleGuard Integration
- RoleGuard uses `effectiveRole` correctly
- **Impact**: None - working as intended

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### To Test the Feature:

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Go to admin home page
   - Verify "View As" section is visible

2. **Test "View as Employee"**
   - Click "Employee" button
   - Should navigate to employee home
   - Should see preview mode banner
   - Should see "(Preview Mode)" in header

3. **Test "View as Trainee"**
   - Click "Trainee" button
   - Should navigate to trainee home
   - Should see preview mode banner
   - Should see "(Preview Mode)" in header

4. **Test Event Registration Prevention**
   - Go to events page
   - Try to register for an event
   - Should see "Preview Mode" alert
   - Registration should be blocked

5. **Test Return to Admin**
   - Click "Exit Preview" on banner
   - Should return to admin home
   - Should reset viewAs state

6. **Test Multiple Return Methods**
   - Use banner button
   - Use reset button in admin home
   - Use return button in event details
   - All should work consistently

## ðŸ“± Console Debug Output

When testing, you should see console logs like:
```
UserContext: setViewAs called with: employee
Admin Home: handleViewAs called with role: employee
EmployeeHome: viewAs state: employee
EventCard: viewAs state: employee
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

If the user still reports issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify State**: Check if viewAs state is being set correctly
3. **Test Navigation**: Ensure router.push/replace is working
4. **Check RoleGuard**: Verify it's not interfering with navigation
