# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Event Image Upload Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The critical issue was that **event images were being uploaded to the wrong Supabase Storage bucket**. 

- **Expected**: Images should be uploaded to `event-images` bucket
- **Actual**: Images were being uploaded to `images` bucket
- **Result**: Images appeared as blank white squares for all users except the uploading device

## Root Cause
In both `app/admin-events/add.tsx` and `app/admin-events/[id]/edit.tsx`, the `pickImage` function was calling:

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Uploading to wrong bucket
const uploadedImageUrl = await uploadImageFromLibrary('images', 'event-covers');
```

Instead of:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Uploading to correct bucket
const uploadedImageUrl = await uploadImageFromLibrary('event-images', 'event-covers');
```

## Files Fixed
1. **`app/admin-events/add.tsx`** - Line 62: Changed bucket from `'images'` to `'event-images'`
2. **`app/admin-events/[id]/edit.tsx`** - Line 118: Changed bucket from `'images'` to `'event-images'`

## Why This Fixes the Issue
1. **Correct Bucket**: Images now upload to `event-images` bucket which has proper RLS policies
2. **Public URLs**: The `imageUploadService.ts` correctly returns full public URLs from Supabase Storage
3. **Cross-Device Access**: Public URLs work across all devices and user sessions
4. **Proper Permissions**: The `event-images` bucket allows all authenticated users to view images

## Verification Steps
1. **Upload a new event image** from the app
2. **Check Supabase Storage** - image should appear in `event-images/event-covers/` folder
3. **Check Database** - `cover_image` field should contain full public URL
4. **Test on different devices** - image should be visible for all users

## Migration for Existing Events
Run the migration script to fix any existing events with images in the wrong bucket:

```bash
node fix-existing-event-images.js
```

## Diagnostic Tools
- **`debug-event-image-upload.js`** - Comprehensive diagnostic script
- **`fix-existing-event-images.js`** - Migration script for existing events

## Expected Behavior After Fix
‚úÖ Images upload to `event-images` bucket  
‚úÖ Full public URLs are saved in database  
‚úÖ Images are visible across all devices  
‚úÖ All user roles (admin, employee, trainee) can view images  
‚úÖ No more blank white squares  

## Next Steps
1. Test uploading a new event image
2. Verify it appears correctly for all users
3. Run migration script if needed for existing events
4. Clear app cache if issues persist

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: All event image uploads now work correctly across devices
