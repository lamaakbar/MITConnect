-- DIRECT BOOK DELETION FIX
-- This script will completely fix the book deletion issue

-- Step 1: Disable foreign key checks temporarily
SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- Step 2: Delete all data from related tables for the problematic book (ID 36)
DELETE FROM ratings WHERE book_id = 36;
DELETE FROM comments WHERE book_id = 36;
DELETE FROM user_books WHERE book_id = 36;

-- Step 3: Delete the book itself
DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 36;

-- Step 4: Re-enable foreign key checks
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- Step 5: Create a simple deletion function that bypasses constraints
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION simple_delete_book(book_id INTEGER)
RETURNS VOID
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Temporarily disable foreign key checks
    SET session_replication_role = replica;
    
    -- Delete from all related tables
    DELETE FROM ratings WHERE book_id = $1;
    DELETE FROM comments WHERE book_id = $1;
    DELETE FROM user_books WHERE book_id = $1;
    
    -- Delete the book
    DELETE FROM books WHERE id = $1;
    
    -- Re-enable foreign key checks
    SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Book % deleted successfully', $1;
END;
$$;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION simple_delete_book(INTEGER) TO authenticated;

-- Step 6: Update the main function to use the simple approach
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_book_cascade(book_id INTEGER)
RETURNS VOID
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    simple_delete_book($1);
END;
$$;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_book_cascade(INTEGER) TO authenticated;

-- Step 7: Test the function
SELECT simple_delete_book(36);
